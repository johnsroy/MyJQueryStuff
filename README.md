# MyJQueryStuff
Some standard ways of using JQuery and the JQuery UI.
Two projects to Look at:
1) My JQuery tutorial of how to use some standard JQuery techniques. (jquerytut.html)
2) My JQuery UI project which targets specific tags and DOM id's and make them look more interactive and user-friendly.(jqueryuitut.html) 
3) Instructions ::: Please copy all the files to your local repository and run the programs in proper text editors like Sublime text or Brackets

A Few interesting WEB DEV projects that are coming up next on my remote Github repo, which I'm going to work on soon:
1) 2 AJAX projects with PHP(parsing both XML and JSON data formats)
2) Backend stuff: Node.js and MongoDB
3) A RESTful API built from scratch
4) Would be launching my own website as well
